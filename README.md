# html5-react-forms

A small demo showing how we can link up [native HTML form validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) with React state using the [Constraint Validation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation#the_constraint_validation_api).
This in turn lets us provide accessible error messages to fields, and announcements of errors when submission is attempted.
Custom validations are also supported to go beyond the built-in validations provided by the browser.

The implementation is contained within the `Form` and `Field` directories. Radix UI components are optional and can be swapped out with regular HTML elements and CSS.
